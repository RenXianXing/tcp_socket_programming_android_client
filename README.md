# Implementation of TCP Socket Programming Client Side in Android

This program is about TCP socket programming client side with Android. This is a dynamic client application, the preferred server IP address can give as a server IP address. After the TCP connection is established with preferred server, the simple messenger application is started. Client and server can have communication with that messenger interface.
